<p>What did you think?</p>
<p> I liked this assignment since I have never used Arc online to make my own map. Since I was
not comfortable using someone elses pictures, due to copyright issues I opted to just use text and use the most basic story map from ESRI and
selecting that typed linked me to UMN's ArcOnline site.
I  liked how easy it was to add points to the map as well as how easy importing data seemed. I could see how I could add more to my map if I needed to.
I did try some of the other kinds of story maps and I think for specific projects they would be really cool, especially if you had picutures or video.
